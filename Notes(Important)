Important plugins:-
Please remember to install express using
$ npm install express
 in your cmd or bash.
I have included the necessary folders like 
serve-static or body-parser, but the rest of the files need to be 
installed using npm. For database work, laravel is recommended. 
I will be developing the database work soon enough as 
I keep learning.
